# Knowledge-based-recommendation-system
# Description:
A knowledge-based recommendation system uses explicit knowledge (like user preferences, expert rules, or item features) to make recommendations, rather than relying on user behavior. This is ideal for domains where:

* Explicit preferences matter (e.g., product features)

* Items are complex, and users need guidance

In this project, we’ll implement a simple knowledge-based recommendation system for recommending laptops based on user preferences for features like battery life, price, and brand.

# ✅ What It Does:
* Simulates a knowledge-based system for recommending laptops

* Filters laptops based on user preferences (brand, battery life, price)

* Outputs laptop recommendations based on expert knowledge or predefined rules
